Concision and Wordiness

Make your writing as concise as possible. This maxim does not mean to eliminate nuance or descriptive language. You can often revise sentences to half their length without losing any meaning. A useful, step-by-step method is described here:

> He mentions that the enjoyment of art is not adaptive (524). What he means by this is that the enjoyment of art did not help humans to survive against the selection pressures we faced.

—

> Pinker explains the aforementioned phenomenon by arguing that the enjoyment of art is an evolutionary byproduct of our adaptation to enjoy being in fitness-enhancing environments.

—

> Pinker explains that the human mind has learnt what stimuli are pleasurable and has devised methods to distil pleasurable stimuli into more concentrated forms (524).

better: Humans thus enjoy supernormal stimuli more than natural pleasurable stimuli.

> Savage et al. propose three reasons as to why music might facilitate social bonding. The first reason is that when humans behave cooperatively through music-making, they engage in prosocial behaviours which are rewarding to humans and facilitate social bonding (3, 11). Prosocial behaviours refer to behaviours that benefit society as a whole, such as cooperation. Savage et al. claim that there is evidence to suggest that oxytocin levels are elevated in individuals after taking part in music activities. Oxytocin promotes individuals to adopt values and dispositions, such as generosity and trust, that facilitate bonding between individuals (11, 12). Oxytocin is a hormone that is released in the brain, that promotes positive feelings in humans, and plays roles in social bonding. Dunbar et al. (2012) add by suggesting that pleasure derived from music is due to stimulation of parts of the brain that release endorphins and dopamine, which are associated with rewards in humans (689). Within these parts of the brain lie the dopaminergic system, that is active when stimuli such as food are present. Stimuli such as food are associated with the presence of rewards and fitness enhancing environments that humans find to be pleasurable. Similarly, the dopaminergic system is also active during the perception of music, indicating that there is a fitness-enhancing environment present. Therefore, music is perceived to be pleasurable to humans.
