title: Assignment feedback
date: 2024-09-20

---

I provide feedback in different ways based on the assignment. My goal is to give you as much guidance as I can within my available time and resources. You are always welcome to ask for clarification and/or more feedback.

## Feedback through text styles

When you submit paper assignments, I use text styles to provide feedback. My hope is that marking some text quickly will be enough for you to figure out the errors on your own, and then I can spend more time giving you written comments in other areas.

What the styles mean:

- light green text means that these words are misleading or technically incorrect in some way
- yellow highlighting indicates either:
	- a grammar error (ask me if the error is not obvious to you)
	- an citation error (either content or formatting, ask me if you can't figure it out AFTER reading the citations page carefully)
- bolded text should be reworded because
	- it has a meaning or connotation that doesn't fit the context,
	- it is not the appropriate tone for academic writing (usually, too informal)
	- it uses complex/"academic" vocabulary where a regular word would be just as good and easier to understand

## Approach to feedback

Sometimes students will say, ""You only commented on part of my paper. Will you comment on the rest?" I understand why it may seem strange that I comment on only limited parts of a paper. To understand my reasons, consider two ways of thinking about paper comments:

- Approach 1: what matters is the quality of the submitted paper, as that determines the student's grade. The student submits a draft. The teacher marks the draft so the student knows what's wrong with the paper. The student revises the paper and submits a final draft. The final draft starts with full marks and the grade is reduced every time the teacher notices a problem. If no major problems remain by the final draft, the paper gets an A.
- Approach 2: what matters is improving the student's writing skills, and writing papers is a way to build those skills. The student submits a draft. The teacher marks the draft so the student can learn ways they can improve their writing skills, both by avoiding errors and by building on strengths. The comments point out concrete examples of writing issues and suggest ways to deal with those issues. Since there are countless ways to improve a paper, the teacher must selectively choose what to comment on. There is no expectation that the teacher will comment on the entire paper, since there is no way to mark every way a draft can be improved (at least, no way that takes less than 3 hours per draft). In terms of comments, the difference between a good and weak draft is not the number of comments, but the type or focus of the comments. Part of the learning process involves the student taking the teacher's guidance and figuring out how to use it to improve their writing even when the teacher does not point out exactly where and when to change things.

In this course, I use approach 2. To be fair to all students, I devote a certain amount of time to each paper. I read the whole paper and record audio or video comments on the main strengths and weaknesses in the draft. With my remaining time, I make marginal comments or style text to indicate areas for the student to review. As I do this, I make on-the-fly decisions about what to comment on and how to phrase my feedback based on the student, the paper, and my other comments so far.

I believe I can achieve my goals of helping you improve your writing without marking every instance of every issue in a draft. I don't feel that my role is to help you make your draft so good that it can't be improved, and (to be honest) neither you nor I have enough time to achieve that goal in one semester even if we wanted to. Of course, if you want to continue work on any papers for the course, such as to improve them for submission to an undergraduate journal, I'm happy to continue working with you to improve them.

If you have any specific questions about parts of the paper that I didn't explicitly comment on, just ask. I'm happy to respond to questions over email or messaging as time allows, or to schedule additional meetings during the week. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts.

<!-- frome email to Mun Hou: Based on your email, I think I didn't communicate the distinction the way I intended. I'm trying to make a distinction between writing where the feedback process is focused on creating an high-quality output (the paper) vs writing where the feedback process is focused on improving writing skills (and the paper is just a means to that end). The former makes sense in a publishing context, where it's important that the entire piece be up to standard, and thus it would be poor practice for an editor to only edit ½ of the piece. And, in most publishing contexts, any piece of writing going through the editing process is good enough at the start that it's realistic to provide feedback on the whole piece.

But in a course, the paper is an artificial construct designed to help students learn skills, so 1) it's not actually important to make sure the whole paper meets a high standard, except in the sense that it affects the student's grade, and 2) the drafts are not strong enough that, in the time limits of the semester, one can realistically make enough comments to get most papers to a version that meets a high standard of writing. -->

<!-- revision:

Many students think that the purpose of feedback is for the instructor to tell the student everything that is "wrong" with the paper. If the student fixes the "mistakes" properly, the paper will get an A. They think of the paper like a test - no mistakes means full marks, so any grade below that is due to an error.

**How I Give Feedback on Your Work**

Most students think their goal in this class is to earn a high grade. They may recognize the value of learning and find the course interesting, but their focus on the final grade frames all aspects of the class: the paper is written to prove mastery of certain skills, those skills are meant to earn a high grade, and feedback is simply to show what needs to be fixed to get that grade. In this view, good feedback tells you everything to correct and how to do it to make your paper an "A" paper. The focus is on the quality of the paper itself rather than developing your academic skills. While you may not have explicitly thought about the purpose of feedback, I suspect most of you see it this way intuitively.

**My Feedback Approach**

In this course, my focus is on helping you become a stronger writer overall, not just improving your paper to earn a particular grade. I care more about your skills than the final product. My feedback is meant to help you grow as a writer by building on your strengths and addressing recurring challenges.

Since there are countless ways to refine a draft, and time is limited, it's impossible to mark every potential improvement. I choose my comments strategically, focusing on areas that will have the greatest impact on your development rather than marking every single issue.

I do not mark every error because pointing out each mistake can be overwhelming and does not always lead to meaningful learning. Instead, I prioritize feedback that helps you recognize patterns in your writing and learn how to improve those patterns in future drafts. There may be large sections of your paper that I do not comment on, especially if those sections are effective or if the feedback I provide elsewhere can be broadly applied. This selective approach encourages you to think critically about your work and apply feedback independently, promoting long-term growth and self-sufficiency as a writer.

To be fair to all students, I spend a set amount of time on each paper. I read the entire draft and provide audio or video comments highlighting the main strengths and areas for improvement. With any remaining time, I add marginal comments or use text styling to indicate areas for review. My comments are always guided by what I believe will be most beneficial for your growth as a writer. A key part of your learning process is using this guidance to improve other areas of your writing.

Effective feedback is about helping you grow without overwhelming you or aiming for unattainable perfection in one draft. If you have questions about parts of your paper that I didn’t explicitly comment on, please ask. I'm happy to respond to questions over email or schedule meetings during the week as time allows. However, I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts.

My feedback is here to help you become a more confident, capable writer. Use my comments as a starting point for reflection and improvement, and remember that each draft and revision is a step toward building your skills further.
