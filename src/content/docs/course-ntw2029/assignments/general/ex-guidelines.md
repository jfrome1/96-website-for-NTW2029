Exercise guidelines

## Overview

Students will regularly submit short written exercises for class as a way to practice writing skills and to reflect on various aspects of the course.

Exercises are not intended to take a very long time to complete. Please aim to finish each of them in one hour or less (not including reading time), and don't spend more than two hours on any exercise.

As exercises are primarily for skill-building, grading is primarily based on closely following these guidelines:

- reflects an honest attempt to do the exercise as described (which includes reading the assignment carefully)
- includes the name I call you in class and your section (E1 or E2) at the top of the exercise
- includes a word count and either a [GenAI link or no-use statement](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy) at the bottom of the exercise
- is submitted by the deadline (or the extended deadline if an [:extension is requested](/course-ntw2029/course-info/extensions)) as described below

## How to submit

- Exercises should be typed directly into the text box on the Canvas submission page (unless otherwise indicated).
- If the exercise asks for a file attachment:
	- any file name is fine
	- please do _not_ paste [:links to documents](#x-no-links) in the text box
- Exercises are always due at 11:59pm. Proper sleep is important for health (both physical and mental) and I do not want you staying up late to finish.
- You may resubmit exercises until the deadline if needed (for example, if you are reading over your submission and see something you need to change).

## Approach

The exercises _should_ be written:

- with proper [:grammar](#x-grammar)
- in full sentences (not bullet points)
- in a [:formal style](#x-formal)
- with a focus on [:simple language](#x-simple) and clear communication

The exercises _should not_ do these things:

- Don't quote or cite sources in the exercises unless I specifically tell you to.
- Don't do any outside research for the exercises; they are a chance to practice your thinking, they are not research exercises where you are supposed to report ideas from other people or sources
- Don't include introductions or conclusions for the exercises; they are not full essays and these elements are not needed

##### :x grammar

Write grammatically so I know that any writing errors are not due to carelessness. Don't write the exercises carelessly with the plan to proofread more carefully for the papers. I need to see what your "good" writing looks like before the paper drafts so I know what I need to teach you.

##### :x formal

By "formal style" I don't mean bureaucratic or pretentious writing; I just mean write it like an essay for class rather than a personal reflection paper, a causal email, or a bunch of notes.

##### :x simple

Many students have been previously trained to demonstrate their intelligence by writing complex sentences with big, fancy words. Don't do that in this course. The ideas are complicated enough and "fancy" writing makes things worse. Demonstrate your intelligence by explaining these complex ideas in a way that's easy to understand, with an awareness of your target audience.

## Grading

- if your submission follows all of the above guidelines, it gets credit (1 point)
- if your submission does not follow all guidelines, it gets no credit (0 points)
- df you have done an really extraordinary job on the exercise that stands above your peers, you may get "double credit" (2 points)

The final grade for Exercises is calculated based on total points accumulated during the term.

## Feedback

- I read all assignments thoroughly, whether or not I write a lot of comments.
- I will write comments on Exercise 2, so let me know if you don't see the comments so we can troubleshoot.
- you are always welcome to [ask for additional feedback](/course-ntw2029/course-info/need-help)
