## Papers

These guidelines apply to papers and all paper-related assignments.

## General requirements

- The easiest way to understand paper format is to look at the comments on this  [properly formatted paper](/downloads/formattedpaper.docx). Make sure to [:show comments](#x-show-comments).
- Submit paper assignments as MS Word documents,_not_ pdfs or other file formats.
- Don't use a cover page, borders, backgrounds, or anything decorative (necessary figures, images, or tables are fine).

##### :x show comments

## Formatting elements of the document

- Leave page headers completely blank/empty
- Add page numbers in the footer, but leave page footers blank otherwise.
- The body of the paper must be double-spaced, left-justified, with the first line of each paragraph indented,  without an extra space between paragraphs. Use [:these MS Word settings](#x-formatting) (or equivalents for other programs).
- The [:paper title](#x-title) should be centered, separated from the first line of the essay by one line/space, in the same font as the paper body, and not bolded or underlined
- The reference list must start on a new page, be double-spaced, left-justified, with a hanging indent for the first line of each reference item, [:without an extra space between paragraphs](#x-extra-line). Use [:these MS Word settings](#x-reference-formatting) (or equivalents for other programs)..

##### :x title

##### :x extra line

The space between the last line of one paragraph and and the first line of the next should be the same as the space between lines within a paragraph. Online essays commonly skip lines between paragraphs because it is harder to add tab indents to webpages than in word processors. Extra blank lines can help readability online, but it is typically incorrect to include them in academic essays. [:Here's how](#x-remove-extra-lines) to remove the extra spacing between paragraphs in Microsoft Word.

##### :x remove extra lines

- Go to the Home tab on the ribbon
- Find the Paragraph section
- Click the little "more" arrow in the lower right corner of the box
- Check/fill the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" option
- To [:make this option your default](#x-default) for new documents, click the box "Set as Default", choose "Set as default for all new documents...", and if you are prompted to save the Normal template, choose to do so

##### :x reference formatting

## Document content requirements

Although paper assignments have different requirements, the following applies to all paper assignments (including those preceding full drafts).

- Start the first page with the following information at the top left-hand corner of the first page of all paper assignments (not in the header):

```text
Your Name
Prof. Frome - NTW2029
Assignment Name (e.g. Paper 1 draft)
Assignment due date
```

- Include in-text citations throughout the paper assignment unless otherwise indicated. Guidelines are on the [Citations](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/citations.md) page.
- Below the assignment, but before the reference list, put a word count and a GenAI link or non-use statement.
- Follow American Psychological Association (APA) formatting rules for capitalization [(here)](https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.HTML) and italics [(here)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/italics-quotations/italics). Hint: you have to actually click those links and read those pages if you want correct formatting; don't rely on my draft feedback about incorrect formatting.
