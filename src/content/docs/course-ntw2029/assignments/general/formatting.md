## Papers

These guidelines apply to papers and all paper-related assignments.

### General requirements

- The easiest way to understand paper format is to look at the comments on this  [properly formatted paper](/downloads/formattedpaper.docx). Make sure to [:show comments](#x-show-comments).
- Submit paper assignments as MS Word documents, _not_ a pdf or other file format.
- Don't use a cover page, borders, backgrounds, or anything decorative (necessary figures, images, or tables are fine).

### Formatting elements of the document

- Leave page headers completely blank/empty
- Add page numbers in the footer, but leave page footers blank otherwise.
- The body of the paper must be double-spaced, left-justified, with the first line of each paragraph indented,  without an extra space between paragraphs. Use [:these settings](#x-formatting).
- The [:paper title](#x-temp) should be centered, separated from the first line of the essay by one line/space, in the same font as the paper body, and not bolded or underlined
- The reference list must start on a new page, be double-spaced, left-justified, with a hanging indent for the first line of each reference item, [:without an extra space between paragraphs](#x-extra-line). Use [:these settings](#x-reference-formatting).

### Document content requirements

- Start the first page with the following information at the top left-hand corner of the first page of all paper assignments (not in the header):

```text
Your Full Name
Prof. Frome - NTW2029
Assignment Name (e.g. Paper 1 draft)
Assignment due date
```

- Include in-text citations throughout the paper assignment unless otherwise indicated. Guidelines are on the [Citations](../../resources/writing/citations) page.
- After the assignment, and before the reference list, put a word count and a GenAI link or non-use statement.
- Follow American Psychological Association (APA) formatting rules for capitalization [(here)](https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.HTML) and italics [(here)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/italics-quotations/italics). Hint: you have to actually click those links and read those pages if you want correct formatting; don't rely on my draft feedback about incorrect formatting.

##### :x extra line

The space between the last line of one paragraph and and the first line of the next should be the same as the space between lines within a paragraph. Online essays commonly skip lines between paragraphs because it is harder to add tab indents to webpages than in word processors. Extra blank lines can help readability online, but it is not the correct style for academic essays. [:Here's how](#x-remove-extra-lines) to remove the extra spacing between paragraphs in Microsoft Word.

##### :x remove extra lines

- Go to the Home tab on the ribbon
- Find the Paragraph section
- Click the little "more" arrow in the lower right corner of the box
- Check/fill the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" option
- To [:make this option your default](#x-default) for new documents, click the box "Set as Default", choose "Set as default for all new documents...", and if you are prompted to save the Normal template, choose to do so

## Outlines

Outline formatting requires

## Outline structure

- At the top, state Pinker's main points for the sections and arguments you plan to discuss (not all arguments in the chapter as a whole). Use two sentences maximum. These should be separate from the outline, above it, and not numbered.
- Follow these main points with numbered/lettered lines in a hierarchical outline form <!-- provide clear image/example here -->. It should have two levels maximum: [:points and subpoints](#x-points).
- At the end, include a correctly formatted reference list with only one source, Pinker, and format the citation for the source correctly.
- Do not include lines about the paper introduction or conclusion in the outline. The thesis stated above the outline will serve as the introduction to the outline.

## Outline content

- Paraphrase all points; do not use direct quotations. Cite page numbers for each point in parentheses (e.g.,  (22-23)); no names or years are needed.
- Attribute claims directly to the source (e.g., "Pinker argues that cooperation evolved...").
- Each point will paraphrase a claim from the source argument.
- Each point in the outline should contain exactly ONE complete sentence--not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point.
- Each point should be [:a COMPLETE sentence](#x-complete) with a clear subject and verb, not a phrase or sentence fragment.
- Avoid using "this" or "it" as the subject of the points
	- Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection." [What is an example of mate selection? Identify it clearly.]
- Each point should be a STATEMENTâ€”not a question.
	- Avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
- Each point should paraphrase [:a claim the source makes about its topic](#x-topic) (meaning a claim about an idea or about another author). Points should NOT make claims about the source as a piece of writing, or describe generally what the source does in the paper.

:::danger
 _The above guideline is very important!_ If you don't follow this rule you will end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument, and that's not the assignment.

### :x points

![points and subpoints](/images/outline-points.jpg)

### :x complete

Correct:

1. Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352).
<br>	A. Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353).
<br>	B. In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).

Incorrect:

1. Dance movements and biological quality (352) (not a sentence)
<br>	A. Effects of male dance movements (352-353) (not a sentence)
<br>	B. Effects of female dance movements (353) (not a sentence)

Incorrect:

1. Action films and video games teach coping by:
<br>A. Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
<br>B. Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.

Problem: (1) is not a complete sentence by itself. (A) and (B) are not complete sentences by themselves. The incorrect format encourages the student to make a list of points without really summarizing them into increasingly broad ideas.

### :x topic

- Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples." (describes how the source is written)
- Correct: "Boyd notes that one modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force." (states the example used in the source argument)

- Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable." (describes what the source author does in general)
- Correct: "Pinker argues that music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA" (states Pinker's actual argument)
