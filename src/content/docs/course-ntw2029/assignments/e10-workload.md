title: Exercise 10 - Workload report
date: 2024-08-13

---

Instructors are told that this course should require an average of 10 hours of work per week, and I want to make sure I am within that guideline. I need your help to make sure I'm meeting this goal.

For this assignment, keep a record of the amount of time you spend on this class and [submit an updated workload report](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/66393/assignments/124142) weekly. I'll move the assignment deadline back a week as each week passes.

Please download a blank [workload report](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3681635/download?verifier=5vZywX2dmrbvOWHp6fMYhvYUq0QGyBTbKRtZdKTY&download_frd=1), save it, and [:log your time](#x-estimate) [:in hours](#x-hours). Include both [:writing](#x-writing) assignments and "preparation", which includes everything else you do for the course outside of class.

:::note
The amount of time you spend on this course will not affect your grade in any way, including your participation grade. I am just collecting data.
:::

# :x estimate

It is fine if your data is not accurate; just make your best estimates.

# :x hours

Report your time in hours, using numbers only (use "2" not "2 hrs"), rounding to the nearest half hour (0.5).

# :x writing

For writing assignments, when you estimate time, _include_ time spent reading Canvas, reading sources, getting feedback on assignments from people, etc.
