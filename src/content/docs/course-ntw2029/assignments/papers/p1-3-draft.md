## Overview

Write an [:expository paper](#x-expository) to explain [:one or more arguments](#x-parts) from Pinker's chapter, "The Meaning of Life", in 1500 words or less.

##### :x expository

An expository paper is one in which you explain someone else's argument, usually in a way that is simpler and clearer than the original source.

##### :x parts

Note that the paper will explain and analyze only a few arguments from Pinker's chapter, not the whole text. See section "Scope" below for details.

## Assignment purpose

Paper 1 will help you build skills needed to [:contribute to an academic conversation](#x-conversation), including explaining and analyzing other people's complex arguments.

##### :x conversation

Academic papers are always part of a larger conversation about their research topic. What others have written is the conversation that has happened so far. Authors add to the conversation by first explaining to readers what others have said and then presenting their own ideas.

We can think about this in terms from _They Say, I Say_. In Paper 1, you will practice the skill of explaining other people's arguments (what "they say") so you can master this skill before writing Paper 2, where you will both explain what others say and defend your own original thesis (what "I say").

## Logistics

- Paper length: 1000-1500 words
- Highlight your thesis sentence(s) and the topic sentence of each paragraph in light blue
- Follow formatting, citation, and GenAI guidelines
- Late submission of any part of the assignment may affect your grade up to 1/3 letter grade per day late (extension requests are allowed per class policy).

## Scope

Pinker's text includes [:several sections](#x-sections): an introductory section making a general argument about why we enjoy art, followed by additional sections making more specific arguments about why we enjoy particular art forms.

Your paper will explain Pinker's general argument from the introduction and [:one or two specific arguments](#x-one-or-two) about a specific art form from [:a section you choose](#x-choose).

##### :x sections

The chapter sections are:

- 521-26 — introduction
- 526-528 — visual arts
- 528-534 — discussion of music structure (do not use)
- 534-538 — music
- 538-543 — narrative fiction <!-- (avoid arguments about tearjerkers/benign masochism, use any other arguments) -->

##### :x choose

Choose one of the sections about a specific art form, either visual arts, music, or narrative fiction. Note that the arguments in each section about why we enjoy specific art forms act as illustrations and/or support for Pinker's argument about why we enjoy art in general.

##### :x one or two

For each specific art form, Pinker discusses a number of different mechanisms that might explain why we enjoy that art form. In the section on music, Pinker numbers each mechanism, but for the other art forms, you'll have to figure out where he shifts from one mechanism to another. For the purposes of this paper, you should consider each mechanism Pinker discusses to be a different argument, and you should discuss only one or two arguments about the specific art form you choose. This guideline is designed to encourage you to discuss each argument in greater depth.

Your thesis should mention both the general and specific arguments you will discuss. Your paper should explain how the specific arguments support/relate to/fit together with the more general argument.

##### :x analyze

Although Paper 1 will not aim to refute the source's arguments or argue against its conclusions, the process of explaining these arguments may make you aware of their potential problems, such as logical gaps, ambiguous statements, or confusing claims.

If you are having trouble explaining an aspect of Pinker's argument, consider the possibility that your confusion is due to a weakness in the argument. If you are able to pin down and describe the nature of that weakness, you may add your analysis to the paper.

## Goals

In writing Paper 1, aim to demonstrate your mastery of several goals that we have discussed and practiced over the last few weeks:

- convey the source's argument [:charitably](#x-charitably) and [:accurately](#x-accurately)
- explain the source argument in a way that your [:target audience](#x-audience) can easily understand
- [:use quotations appropriately](#x-quotations) to demonstrate credibility and to support your claims
- optionally, [:analyze the argument to reveal its limits](#x-analyze), gaps, or ambiguities

Your explanation should reflect your [:critical reading](#x-critical-reading) of the argument rather than a general understanding.

##### :x charitably

As discussed in class, charitable summaries of other's arguments help build credibility with readers. Further, charitable summaries lead to significant discussions regarding what is actually true, while uncharitable summaries often lead to fruitless arguments about what various people said or didn't say.

##### :x accurately

To accurately explain part of the source, you must balance various goals. Your explanation of the source argument should not include every idea in the source material, but only the key ideas most important for your paper. However, while including only some of the source's ideas, you must also be careful not to mislead the reader about the scope or meaning of the original source. For example, don't say "Pinker explains why we enjoy music based on auditory scene analysis", say "One way Pinker explains why..."

##### :x audience

Papers should be written for a generalist, educated audience, such as a first-year NUSC student who has not taken this course.
Your paper can assume that your reader has a basic understanding that evolution refers to how species change their traits over time but has no knowledge of its specific mechanisms. For example, don't assume that the reader knows what the EEA is or what "reproductive fitness" means. Also, assume your reader has never read the specific source the paper discusses.

##### :x quotations

The paper should balance summary, paraphrasing, quotation, and explication to make your explanation far clearer and easier to understand than the original source.

- Summarize by omitting details unnecessary for your purposes.
- Paraphrase to convey ideas using clear wording.
- Quote when needed for credibility and to identify key terms.
- Explicate by defining terms and spelling out implicit ideas or assumptions so your non-expert reader can easily follow the argument.

Use brief quotations frequently enough that the reader will get the impression that your explanation is the result of a close reading of the source. You might quote keyterms, phrases central to your explanation of the argument, and phrases relevant to your analysis (especially when you note limitations of the argument).

##### :x critical reading

In the phrases "critical thinking" and "critical reading," the word "critical" doesn't mean "criticizing," but "careful and evaluative". A "critical reading" is not a reading that criticizes the source or explains why it is wrong. It is one where you use critical thinking to analyze the argument and evaluate whether its claims are true and whether the argument as a whole is persuasive.

Aim to go beyond a general understanding of the source, which is what might be captured in an article abstract: the source's main conclusions and (sometimes) their main evidence or arguments for those conclusions. Describing these elements in your paper demonstrates only a general understanding of the source.

An explanation that reflects critical thinking will go beyond describing these elements. It will not just the conclusion, but the specific steps that support that conclusion. It will not just provide a surface-level description of the source's supporting claims, arguments, and evidence, but will "connect the dots" for the reader, explaining these elements more clearly than the original, bringing out implicit assumptions, and identifying key places that the source argument succeeds and fails.

## Framing the paper

The introduction should be one or two paragraphs maximum. It should orient the reader, briefly introduce (but [:not fully explain](#x-explain)) any concepts needed to understand the thesis, and end with the thesis statement.

The thesis statement should be one or two sentences at most and should preview all [:main claims](#x-claims) of your paper.

##### :x claims

The thesis _should_ briefly summarize the arguments from Pinker that the paper will discuss (e.g., "Pinker argues that...").

If your paper makes any evaluative observations about Pinker's arguments, the thesis _should_ briefly summarize your points, which can be done explicitly ("I agree with Pinker that...") or implicitly ("While Pinker's explanation of X is persuasive, his argument that Y is less convincing.")

The thesis _should not_ merely describe the paper's topic (e.g., "This paper will discuss/explore/focus on..."), and such descriptions are rarely needed.

##### :x explain

The introduction is not the place to explain arguments in a detailed manner. Tell the reader just what they need to know to understand your thesis statement. If the introduction has standard academic structure, the reader will understand that any brief explanations in the introduction will be fully explained in the body of the paper.

## Strategies to use and avoid

Your paper _should_ use [:these strategies](#x-should):

Your paper _may_ use [:these strategies](#x-may) (not required, consider these a stretch goal):

Your paper _should not_ use [:these strategies](#x-should-not):

##### :x should

Strategies you should use include:

- identify Pinker's [:main research question](#x-main) and explain only the parts of the source that address that specific question
- allocate enough time to understand Pinker's arguments
 - Since the reading you will respond to is academic writing about a fairly complex topic, you should expect to spend quite a long time reading and taking notes. Your understanding of the argument will develop and deepen as you re-read the source, take notes on it, and write about it.
- start by assuming that Pinker's arguments make sense and identify the claims he uses to build his arguments
 - In this paper, you will analyze specific arguments made by the source. Don't make the mistake of thinking about the source's argument as a general topic or a main idea. Think about the argument in terms of specific claims that are being made, and specific reasons and evidence that are put forth to support these claims.
- see if you can "help" Pinker make his case more persuasively, trying to "steelman" the argument, but make sure that you:
 - keep your summary accurate and don't misrepresent Pinker in trying to explicate his argument
 - make very clear to the reader which arguments are yours and which are Pinker's
- illustrate Pinker's abstract claims with original concrete examples

##### :x main

Don't forget that an important part of understanding the source's argument is figuring out what academic conversation it is aiming to contribute to and what ideas it is responding to.

In class, we noted that Pinker talks about why the psychology of the arts is obscure and about status before clarifying his main question: why do we enjoy art? Paper 1 should focus on arguments related to this question.

##### :x may

Strategies you may use include:

- objectively describe [:potential gaps or problems](#x-problems) with the argument that you have identified
- discuss the implications of any specific problems for the argument's persuasiveness or [:explanatory power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanatory_power) overall
- identify limits to Pinker's arguments in explaining our enjoyment of [:some genres/types of art but not other broadly popular types](#x-genres)

##### :x problems

Possible problems an author can make include:

- does not explain connections between claims
- uses a term in different ways in different areas of the argument
- makes ambiguous claims
- uses a term in ways that do not match with standard EP usage

##### :x genres

For example, Pinker mentions different types of music, and one of his arguments explaining the pleasures of music may apply to one type he mentions but not other popular types. Of course, don't bother discussing examples of very small genres that most people don't like; stick to discussing broadly popular genres.

##### :x should not

Strategies you _should not_ use include:

- don't assume you should [:use Pinker's language](#x-language)
- don't propose [:an original, alternate answer](#x-alternate) to the author's research question
- don't use any sources other than Pinker
- don't criticize EP or other aspects of Pinker's argument that are [:defended in other parts of his book](#x-criticize)
- don't provide counterarguments or counterexamples to [:refute Pinker's claims](#x-refute)
- don't criticize the source argument for [:failing to live up to ideal standards](#x-ideal) for academic arguments in general

##### :x refute

This paper's goal is to explain and (optionally) analyze the source argument, not to refute the argument. It is fine to use arguments and examples to show the limits of Pinker's claims, but don't try to show that his claims are wrong.

##### :x criticize

Sometimes, Pinker refers to arguments he makes in other chapters of the book, including arguments about the validity of EP in general. It doesn't make sense to speculate about these arguments without reading them carefully, so they are outside the scope of Paper 1.

##### :x language

Obviously, in explaining Pinker, you will use some similar terms.However, your goals are different than his. Pinker's writing is more concerned with engagement than clarity. Did you find it easy to understand his arguments on first reading? I didn't. Your paper should aim to explain his arguments so clearly that a generalist reader can understand them with minimal effort after reading your paper just one time. Use consistent keyterms with clear meanings, whether or not Pinker does.

##### :x alternate

This mistake would look something like this: "Pinker's argument has a limitation in that [describes a problem]. A better explanation for why we enjoy music is..."

It is ok to try to "fix" Pinker's argument by offering better reasons a mechanism he proposes (such as auditory scene analysis) explains why we enjoy an art form. It is not ok to propose a different mechanism that Pinker doesn't mention.

##### :x ideal

Some criticisms could be leveled at almost any published work, so they don't really advance the academic conversation. Avoid these non-constructive, generic criticisms:

- "some readers would not be convinced by the source argument"
- "the source [:ignores other factors](#x-ignores) that might also partially explain this phenomenon"
- "the source [:doesn't define](#x-define) the term 'X'"
- "the source [:doesn't provide evidence](#x-evidence) for claim X"
- "the source says X but X is not true [:100% of the time](#x-100)"
- "the source uses term 'X' [:in the wrong way](#x-wrong-term)"

##### :x 100

Sources have to generalize to make useful claims about the world, and it is almost never the case that a claim is true 100% of the time.

Don't get me wrong; it is potentially useful to discuss counterexamples if they show limits to the source argument, but it is your responsibility to argue that these limitations have a significant consequence on the explanatory power of the source's argument as a whole.

##### :x evidence

It's impossible to write a paper that provides evidence for every single claim it makes. It is fine to discuss lack of evidence for a claim if a reader might reasonably doubt the claim, but there's no value in pointing out a lack of evidence for a claim that seems true unless you have a reason to dispute it. It is your responsibility to argue that any lack of evidence has a significant consequence on the explanatory power of the source's argument as a whole.

##### :x ignores

No explanation can include every possible factor. It is possible to write a successful academic paper that includes this type of criticism, but it won't work for the Paper 1 assignment.

##### :x define

Sources can fairly assume that readers know some terms and concepts. Your job is to provide a better explanation of the source argument, so if Pinker is confusing because he doesn't define a term, you can define it in your paper.

It's potentially useful to discuss the meaning of a term if the source uses it in conflicting ways, or if you are going to analyze possible meanings based on other parts of the text, but simply pointing out that some term isn't defined is not useful on its own.

##### :x wrong term

Paper 1 assumes that the source is not completely self-explanatory and clear. The principle of charity suggests that we should aim to steelman the source argument to focus on whether its most persuasive version is true.

## Checklist

Your paper should include:

- an introduction that meets the guidelines discussed in class
- a thesis statement covering just the arguments in Pinker's chapter that you choose to explain and analyze as well as any conclusions from your anaylsis
- sufficient quotation and citation to convince the reader that the paper reflects a careful and accurate reading of the source
- proper framing, in a "quote sandwich", of any longer quotes used
- proper in-text citation and a correctly formatted reference list (which will include only one source, Pinker)
- definitions of [:key terms](#x-terms)
- a brief conclusion that simply restates the main points of your paper

##### :x terms

You can assume your reader knows these basic evolutionary terms:

- evolution
- species
- traits/phenotype
- survival and reproduction
- genes/genotype
- fitness
- natural selection
- sexual selection

You should briefly define the terms "adaptation" and "byproduct" if you use them. No extensive explanation nor illustrative examples are needed for these terms themselves. However, any claims you make with these terms must still be explained and/or illustrated to make them clear to the reader.
