title: Paper 1 final
date: 2024-09-22

---

Please review the Paper 1 assignment, including the revised checklist at the end. Go through the checklist carefully. Submissions that fail to meet assignment formatting, GenAI, or citation guidelines [:must be revised before they will be accepted](#x-accepted). I'll notify you of the error, and your revised version will be considered late.

:::danger[Please note]
**_For the final draft, you must highlight your thesis sentence(s) and the topic sentence of each paragraph in light blue_**.
:::

The thesis should be at the end of your introduction. Your topic sentences should be the first (or, occasionally, the second) sentence in each of your paragraphs.

You should also remove any text styling (highlighting, text color, bold) and comments that I added to the draft.

##### :x accepted

I'm not going to require revision based on small formatting or citation errors; I'm talking about a clear failure to include something explicitly listed as a requirement, such as the reference list or a GenAI link/statement.
