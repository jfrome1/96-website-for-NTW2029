To be posted

<!-- ## Paper 2 final

- Submit Paper 2 as an attached Word document. Upload the file, don't post a link to the file.
- Maximum paper length for the final draft is 2500 words.
- Follow all other paper instructions, including highlighting, formatting, citations, etc.
- Do not submit your papers late. Plan to submit them at least two hours before the deadline in case you need time to sort any technological issues. In case of a very unlikely emergency problem with Canvas, before the deadline, email the paper to me as plain text (copy and paste the paper into an email, don't attach a file), send me a pic of the Canvas error, and submit the paper as a properly formatted file as soon as possible.
- Note that you must submit Assignment 9 to get credit for Paper 2.
