Please review the Paper 1 assignment carefully before submitting.

Make sure that your submission includes the following:

- page numbers
- reference list
- GenAI links (checked to make sure they work) or non-use statement
- highlighted thesis and topic sentences

This is not a comprehensive checklist, obviously, but I need these things to respond to your paper.  Thus, if any of these are missing, I'll notify you and ask you to fix the error, and the paper will be considered late.

The thesis should be at the end of your introduction. Your topic sentences should be the first (or, occasionally, the second) sentence in each of your paragraphs.

You should also remove any text styling (highlighting, text color, bold) and comments that I added to the draft.
