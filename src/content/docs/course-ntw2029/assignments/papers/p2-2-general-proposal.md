title: Paper 2 general topic proposal
---

## Assignment purpose

- Paper 2 asks you to explain, analyze, and (optionally) correct or improve a published academic argument. The goal of the general topic proposal assignment is to identify a general topic area to help you find a  source to analyze that will be more likely to interest you.
- For this assignment, propose two or more topic areas related to EP and art that you might be interested in focusing on for your final paper. Briefly explain your possible interest, using several sentences for each topic. Feel free to mention specific examples.
- Propose at least two topics to increase the chance that one of them will be suitable. I will provide feedback on your suggestions to guide you in the right direction.
- Make your topics fairly different from each other; if you pick two related topics in an area that is not suitable, you'll have to start over.
- Although you can discuss your interest in terms of questions that interest you, remember that you are not choosing a research question to answer in your paper; you are choosing a topic area to help you find a source you will enjoy analyzing.

## Topic guidelines

- don't ask "why is X popular?" (we cannot know without market research)
- the more modern or specific a genre is, the less likely its existence or features can be explained with EP (although some common responses to it might be explainable with EP)
- focus on more general and universal phenomena that are true of most people rather than more unusual or limited phenomena that may not lead to any published sources (e.g. the question "why doesn't my mom find horror movies scary?" is an interesting question, but is not one that someone has published research papers about)

## Finding a topic

Here are some concepts we have discussed in class that may spur topic ideas:

- art (or certain art forms) as an adaptation or a byproduct
- differences between art creation and art consumption
- gender differences
- EP methodology (e.g. what counts as evidence, what is an explanation)
- storytelling and social norms/values
- intrasexual competition vs. mate attraction
- appeal of types of art that evoke negative emotions
- artistic representations vs. reality (in terms of our responses)
- theory of mind
- altruism vs. cooperation
- "our stone-age minds are not adapted to the modern world"

Another approach to identifying topics that might interest you is browsing through existing EP and art-related research. One relevant journal is [_Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture_](https://www-degruyter-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/journal/key/esic/html).

<!-- Another way to get a sense of research in an area is to look at [:literature reviews](#x-literature).

How can I tell if a source is a literature review? Clues include:

- it is a chapter in an anthology or a handbook
- anthologies
	- anthologies are books where each chapter is written by a different person
	- anthology chapters are sometimes, but not always, literature reviews
	- chapters in anthologies are independent and are related only by general topic area
	- handbooks list an editor or editors on the front cover rather than an author, e.g. "edited by Luicano Floridi"
	- the editor often writes a chapter of the book and is responsible for editing the chapters and managing the project
- handbook
	- handbooks are anthologies that aim to give researchers an overview of topics in a field, with each chapter about a different topic
		- handbook chapters are almost always literature reviews
	- handbooks usually have words like "handbook", "guide to", and "companion to" in their titles, as well as a publisher's name, e.g.:
		- _The Oxford handbook of philosophical methodology_
		- _The Palgrave handbook of the philosophy of film and motion pictures_
		- _The Routledge companion to video game studies_
		- _The Routledge handbook of evolution and philosophy_
		- _The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information_
- it has no clear "they say" that the source is arguing against, or the "they say" is something like "some people might think" but doesn't include any arguments against what other scholars have published
- it lists a number of different theories about a topic but doesn't clearly defend a particular theory

##### :x literature

- Most research articles summarize previous research in their introductions, to provide context regarding what other people have said in the academic conversation, and this section of an article is often referred to as a literature review
- However, there are also sources that are entirely literature reviews; they generally do not propose and defend theses but simply provide overviews of research in an area
- Note: since they do not propose and defend arguments, literature review sources are NOT appropriate as a primary source for Paper 2
