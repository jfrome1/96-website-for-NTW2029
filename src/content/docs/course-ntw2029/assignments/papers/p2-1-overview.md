## Overview

Write a paper of 2000-2500 words that clearly [:explains and analyzes](#x-explains) a recent published academic argument about EP and art to your target audience.

This paper likely has different goals than [:other final papers](#x-other) you have written in the past.

##### :x explains

- explain the source's attempted contribution to an ongoing academic conversanion
- analyze some specific aspect of that argument in a way that adds to the academic conversation by telling your reader what you think/how they should think about your source (and, optionally and if appropriate, a way the argument could be improved)
- even more detail: To successfully write Paper 2, your paper will analyze a specific part of your source's argument, which requires you to complete a number of tasks. Below I've listed these tasks to give you an overview of the process. The tasks are:
	- identify the academic conversation the source is aiming to participate in
	- understand the source's argument regarding this conversation ("they say")
	- summarize the source argument broadly in order to orient the reader to the specific part of the argument you want to challenge
	- summarize the specific part of the argument you want to analyze (this part doesn't have to be an individual claim, it can be a main point of the argument, or an idea or concept, or the significance of the argument, etc.)
	- analyze the argument to identify some way you can add to the conversation
	- make a claim (your thesis) evaluating, correcting, and/or extending about some specific and limited part of the source argument ("I say")
	- support your claim with reasoning (explanation and analysis) and evidence (quotations from and paraphrases of the source and/or from other sources)
	- explain why your thesis is significant to and/or adds to the academic conversation (note that I am not asking you to show that your challenge is significant to the world at large or to social policy or anything like that)


##### :x other

- Your goal is NOT to answer a research question by synthesizing what other people have said about it. This course demands a more ambitious goal.
- Your goal is NOT to try to answer a research question by proposing and defending your own theory about EP and art. That is overly ambitious and not realistic given the time limits and introductory nature of this course.

- "recent" means within the last ten years (exceptions can be made, just ask, but at least try to find more recent rather than less)
- academic sources do not include personal webpages, Wikipedia, or most blogs (exceptions exist)
- academic sources include books and journals published by a university press or an academic press

## Assignment purpose

Paper 1 will help you build skills needed to [:contribute to an academic conversation](#x-conversation), including explaining and analyzing other people's complex arguments.

## Logistics

- Paper length: 1000-1500 words

- Highlight your thesis sentence(s) and the topic sentence of each paragraph in light blue

- Follow formatting, citation, and GenAI guidelines

- Late submission of any part of the assignment may affect your grade up to 1/3 letter grade per day late (extension requests are allowed per class policy).

## Scope

Pinker's text includes [:several sections](#x-sections): an introductory section making a general argument about why we enjoy art, followed by additional sections making more specific arguments about why we enjoy particular art forms.

## Goals

In writing Paper 1, aim to demonstrate your mastery of several goals that we have discussed and practiced over the last few weeks:

- convey the source's argument [:charitably](#x-charitably) and [:accurately](#x-accurately)
- explain the source argument in a way that your [:target audience](#x-audience) can easily understand
- [:use quotations appropriately](#x-quotations) to demonstrate credibility and to support your claims
- optionally, [:analyze the argument to reveal its limits](#x-analyze), gaps, or ambiguities

Your explanation should reflect your [:critical reading](#x-critical-reading) of the argument rather than a general understanding.

## Framing the paper

The introduction should be one or two paragraphs maximum. It should orient the reader, briefly introduce (but [:not fully explain](#x-explain)) any concepts needed to understand the thesis, and end with the thesis statement.

The thesis statement should be one or two sentences at most and should preview all [:main claims](#x-claims) of your paper.

## Strategies to use and avoid
## Checklist

Your paper should include:

- an introduction that meets the guidelines discussed in class
- a thesis statement covering just the arguments in Pinker's chapter that you choose to explain and analyze as well as any conclusions from your anaylsis
- sufficient quotation and citation to convince the reader that the paper reflects a careful and accurate reading of the source
- proper framing, in a "quote sandwich", of any longer quotes used
- proper in-text citation and a correctly formatted reference list (which will include only one source, Pinker)
- definitions of [:key terms](#x-terms)
- a brief conclusion that simply restates the main points of your paper

Paper 2 goal: clearly explain and analyze a recent published academic argument about EP and art to your target audience.
