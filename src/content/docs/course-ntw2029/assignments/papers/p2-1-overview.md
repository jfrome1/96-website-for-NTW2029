title: Paper 2

---

## Overview

Write a paper that clearly [:explains and analyzes](#x-explains) a [:recent published academic argument](#x-recent) about EP and art to [:your target audience](#x-target).

This paper likely has different goals than [:other final papers](#x-other) you have written in the past.

The assignment is broken into many parts to guide you through the process. You can do this!

##### :x explains

- explain the source's attempted contribution to an ongoing academic conversation
- analyze some specific aspect of that argument in a way that adds to the academic conversation by telling your reader what you think/how they should think about your source (and, optionally and if appropriate, a way the argument could be improved)

##### :x recent

- "recent" means within the last ten years (exceptions can be made, just ask, but at least try to find more recent rather than less)
- academic sources do not include personal webpages, Wikipedia, or most blogs (exceptions exist)
- academic sources include books and journals published by a university press or an academic press
- university presses include the university name (e.g. University of Chicago Press or Oxford University Press)
- academic presses that are not university presses include [:these presses](#x-presses)

##### :x presses

- Elsevier
- Springer
- Wiley-Blackwell
- Taylor & Francis
- Sage Publications
- Palgrave Macmillan
- Brill
- Routledge
- De Gruyter
- Nature Publishing Group
- PLOS (Public Library of Science)
- The Royal Society

##### :x target

In this course, your target audience is an NUSC student without expertise in your topic.

##### :x other

- Your goal is NOT to answer a research question by synthesizing what other people have said about it. This course demands a more ambitious goal.
- Your goal is NOT to try to answer a research question by proposing and defending your own theory about EP and art. That is overly ambitious and not realistic given the time limits and introductory nature of this course.

## Assignment purpose

Paper 2 will allow you to build writing skills to achieve the learning goals of the course.

## Logistics

- Paper length: 2250-2750 words, excluding reference list
- Your specific paper topic and main source must be approved and finalized before the Paper 2 brief source summary due week 9
- Your paper must use at least four academic sources
- These include one primary source (the focus of your analysis) and three or more supporting sources
- With approval, you may also compare two primary sources and use two or more supporting sources
- You must submit all parts of the assignment to get credit for the paper
- Late submission of any part may affect your grade up to 1/3 letter grade per day late

## Paper 2 process

Pre-drafting

- Paper 2 general topic proposal (due week 7): suggest some topics of interest related to EP and art
- Paper 2 academic conversation overview (due week 8): choose a topic and describe a few relevant sources
- Paper 2 brief source summary and context (due week 9): after finalizing your main source, briefly summarize your source's contribution to an academic conversation
- Paper 2 source summary outline (due Wed of week 10): create a brief outline of the source to help you understand its argument and structure
- Paper 2 proposal and revised source summary outline (due week 10): I'll provide questions to help you figure out how to approach your source analysis; you submit answers to those questions as your Paper 2 proposal and attach a revised source summary outline

Drafting

- Paper 2 introduction and full outline (due week 11): write a draft introduction to Paper 2, including a proposed thesis, and a full draft outline of Paper 2
- Paper 2 full draft (due week 12): write a full draft that does these things:
- contextualize the source argument within a larger academic conversation
- explain the source argument
- analyze the source argument
- explain the implications of your analysis
- (optional) correct the argument

Revision

- Paper 2 final paper (due just after week 13):
- refine the paper thesis, structure, examples, and analysis
- refine the transitions and sentence-level writing
- proofread, polish, check citations and formatting

Detailed guidance for each of these steps will be provided in future assignments
