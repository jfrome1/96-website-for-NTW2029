<!-- Paper 2 full draft and outline

Please follow the guidelines for the assignment "Intro Draft and Outline" with the following differences:

- Part 1 (draft): submit the full draft rather than just a partial draft
- Part 2 (outline): in your hierarchical outline, your points should be the exact topic sentences from your draft that correspond to each of the points in the outline. Your outline will thus have the same number of points as you have paragraphs in the draft. If the outline doesn't make sense when you do it this way, it is ok to write the points in different words and then follow them with a quoted topic sentence from your paper draft. If you have trouble making the outline and draft work in this way, just do your best and include a note explaining why this guideline didn't work for you (to help me improve the assignment in the future).
