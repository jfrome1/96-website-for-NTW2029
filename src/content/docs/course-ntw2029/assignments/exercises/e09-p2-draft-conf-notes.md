title: Exercise 9 - Paper 2 post-conference notes (draft conference)
date: 2024-10-12

---
Please submit post-conference notes about the most important points you took from our conference and from my feedback on your draft. There is no word count requirement; I'll leave it up to you.

Copy and paste these questions into the Exercise 9 text box on Canvas. Keep the questions and type your answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? What will you do to figure them out?
5. (optional) Do you any other comments or feedback for me?

After this conference, you can still email or message me short questions that I can quickly answer. You can also request an in-person meeting or Zoom call and I'll do my best to accommodate you. But I am not able to provide feedback on emailed drafts or paper sections before the final is due.
