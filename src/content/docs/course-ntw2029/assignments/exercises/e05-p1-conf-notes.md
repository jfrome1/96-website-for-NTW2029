title: Exercise 5 - Paper 1 post-conference notes
date: 2024-08-13

---
Please submit post-conference notes about the most important points you took from our conference and from my feedback on your draft. There is no word count requirement; I'll leave it up to you.

Your notes should include:

1. the most important points of feedback on your draft
2. your planned next steps for revising your draft
3. (optional) any other comments or feedback for me

After this conference, you can still email or message me short questions that I can quickly answer. You can also request an in-person meeting or Zoom call and I'll do my best to accommodate you. But I am not able to provide feedback on emailed drafts or paper sections before the final is due.
