## Assignment purpose

This assignment is the step in learning to explain (summarize and explicate) a complex text. This text is more complex than the last, and the challenge is less about deciding what parts of the text to include and more about understanding the argument well enough to explain it.

This assignment is optional. You can request an extension. If you complete it, you will receive feedback and points. If not, this assignment's points will be excluded when calculating your grade.

### Goals

- read and understand the text
- summarize the main argument
- identify and explicate any ideas that your target audience would not otherwise understand
- properly attribute ideas to their sources

## Instructions

<!-- Explain either section 2.7.4 (Group A) or 2.7.5 (Group B) of Goldfinch, Andrew. _Rethinking Evolutionary Psychology_. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. I will assign you to Group A or Group B in class. The explanation should not have an introduction or a conclusion. Citations are not necessary for this exercise. Keep your submission under 500 words.

Explain either section 2.7.4 or 2.7.5 (your choice) of Goldfinch, Andrew. _Rethinking Evolutionary Psychology_. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. The explanation should not have an introduction or a conclusion. Citations are not necessary for this exercise. Keep your submission under 500 words.

## Guidance

Your goal is to explain the main points of a section of Goldfinch for your target audience. Shorten the text by leaving out out details not necessary for the reader to understand the overall argument. Expand the text to explicate ideas, assumptions, and other elements that are crucial to the argument but are not clearly explained by Goldfinch in a way your audience would understand.

This reading comes from a book by an academic publisher, written for other academics who are at least somewhat familiar with the topic. You may find the text challenging!

Don't assume that you should explain each paragraph and present the information in the same order as the original. Think about what is and isn't needed to explain these pages to your reader so they understand Goldfinch's main points.

Make sure to properly attribute all ideas to their source rather than writing them as if they are your original ideas. In this case, it is harder, because Goldfinch is explaining what other people have said. Thus, don't write, "Claims about adaptive traits..." or "Richardson argues that claims about adaptive traits..." but "According to Goldfinch, Richardson argues that claims about adaptive traits...". It's hard to do this gracefully, so don't worry about it too much for this exercise.

## Feedback

For this exercise, after the submission deadline, I'll post an example explanation on this page for you to compare to your submission. I'll also make brief individualized comments with suggestions for writing improvement. You are welcome to ask for additional feedback either in an in-person meeting or by posing specific questions via Canvas comments or email.

## Checklist

- Explain one section of the text to your target audience
- Limit the explanation to 500 words or less
- Properly attribute all ideas (citation is not needed for this exercise)
- Review and follow all [exercise guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/exercise-guidelines)

## Example explanations of 2.7.1 to 2.7.3

Read these [example explanations](/downloads/goldfinch62-71-JFexplanation.pdf) I've provided for you. Go back and forth, comparing the original to my explanation, to see what ideas I chose to include, exclude, or expand.

## Example explanations of 2.7.4 and 2.7.5

> 2.7.4 The Thinness of Evolutionary Psychology Explanation
>
> According to Goldfinch, Richardson (2007) thinks evolutionary psychology (EP) explanations are "unconstrained speculation" that are unlikely to ever be confirmed by evidence (64).
>
> According to Goldfinch, Richardson's argument is as follows: To claim a trait is an adaptation is to make the historical claim that the trait became common in a species because it enhanced reproductive fitness in a past environment (65). To validate such a claim (i.e., to provide a complete explanation of a trait) we must do more than just posit a possible scenario in which the trait became widespread, we must show that this scenario actually occurred, using reliable historical information about past populations and environments. [:For example](#x-examples), to validate a adaptation claim, we would need evidence that the trait is heritable, since evolution explains only heritable traits. Further, to completely rule out alternate hypotheses, we would need to know whether the trait actually increased reproductive fitness in the past, which would require evidence about the numbers of offspring created by ancestral individuals with the trait as compared to those without it (65). However, these specifics are lacking, as shown by looking at several well-known examples of EP research (66).
>
> Goldfinch affirms Richardson's argument that EP explanations often lack strong evidential support for some of their claims, noting that this point has been made by EP critics as far back as the 1990s (66, 68). He notes that Richardson goes even further, saying that such evidence is lacking not just in past research, but is likely to be absent in future research as well (67).
>
> 2.7.5 [:The Mystery of Discovery](#x-section)
>
> According to Goldfinch, many philosophers dismiss EP based on legitimate concerns that its theories allow multiple, competing hypotheses to be suggested for any given adaptation. Thus, these critics say, EP's ability to explain known [:phenomena](#x-phenomena) is worthless. Further, Goldfinch states, EP can propose many different possible solutions to a given adaptive problem, we cannot rely on its predictive abilities to discover anything new (68-69).
>
> Goldfinch argues that these limitations cause many philosophers to ignore EP's [:"heuristic aspects"](#x-heuristic), a phrase that refers to EP's capacity to suggest hypotheses that would only be developed in light of evolutionary theories. EP often defends its usefulness by arguing that EP-inspired hypotheses have led to discovery of new phenomena. For example, EP defenders say that Cosmides and Tooby (1992) used EP theories to hypothesize that a specialized mechanism for detecting cheaters would be a useful adaptation for species that would benefit from cooperation, and experiments using the Wason Selection Task confirmed this hypothesis in humans [:(69-71)](#x-pages).
>
> Schultz (2011) challenges EP's claims of novel discoveries, Goldfinch states, arguing that, while it is hypothetically possible for EP to discover new things, in actual practice, EP merely explains known phenomena in ways consistent with the theory (71). For example, regarding the cheater detection hypothesis, Schulz argues that the results of the Wason selection task were published in 1966, long before EP developed. Thus, he states, EP merely explained this phenomenon rather than discovering it. Goldfinch notes that Schulz challenges several prominent examples of EP research in the same manner (70-71).

##### :x examples

Here, I provide two examples of the types of evidence that Richardson claims a complete EP explanation would need. In the source, Goldfinch lists five categories of evidence and even more specific examples of evidence. I made a judgement that the reader could understand the objection proposed in this section without knowing all of these details, as the main thrust of the objection is that a complete explanation would require types of evidence that EPs can never obtain. It's less important that the reader learn the exact types discussed in the section unless we intend to analyze each one in our writing.

##### :x section

In the source, Goldfinch relies heavily on ideas he has already discussed, so he is not worried about delivering ideas in the order needed for a generalist reader to understand. Thus, this brief explanation required significant reorganization of ideas. I also chose to include just one of the examples mentioned in the original, believing that it fairly illustrated the general objection outlined in this section.

##### :x phenomena

In this context, phenomena (singular: phenomenon) is just a term meaning "something that happens often enough to be a noticeable type of event"

##### :x heuristic

Here, I expanded the text to explain the notion of "heuristic aspects", which is central to this section.

##### :x pages

Here, I combined a number of ideas from across the section, so my in-text citation covers multiple pages.
