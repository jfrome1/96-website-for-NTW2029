title: Exercise 11 - Workload report
date: 2025-01-15
---

Instructors are told that this course should require an average of 10 hours of work per week, and I want to make sure I am within that guideline. I need your help to make sure I'm meeting this goal.

For this assignment, keep a record of the amount of time you spend on this class and [submit an workload report](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/66393/assignments/124142) as indicated on the schedule.

Please download a blank [workload report](/downloads/2420-NTW2029workload.docx), save it, and [:log your time](#x-estimate) [:in hours](#x-hours). Include both [:writing](#x-writing) assignments and "preparation", which includes everything else you do for the course outside of class.
``
:::note
The amount of time you spend on this course will not affect your grade in any way, including your participation grade. I am just collecting data.
:::

Record your time every week, and submit the report as indicated on the schedule. For this one exercise, just upload a file attachment. You don't need to put anything in the text box.

When you submit your report, please submit it in the original `.docx` format, not as a `.doc`, `.pdf` or other file type. If you open the report in Pages, make sure to Export the file to `.docx`, as I can't read files saved in the default format in Pages.

### :x estimate

It is fine if your data is not accurate; just make your best estimates.

### :x hours

Report your time in hours, using numbers only (use "2" not "2 hrs"), rounding to the nearest half hour (0.5).

### :x writing

For writing assignments, when you estimate time, _include_ time spent reading Canvas, reading sources, getting feedback on assignments from people, etc.
