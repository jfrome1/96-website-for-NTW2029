title: Exercise 11 - Paper 2 writing reflection
date: 2024-08-13

---
The purpose of this exercise is to encourage you to critically reflect on how you approached Paper 2 and what you learned from the writing process.

Please answer the following questions. Don't try to use your answers to present a curated image of yourself as a writer; these answers will not affect your paper grade, and you will benefit most from honest reflection. Answers can be as long or short as needed (no word count requirements).

Copy and paste these questions into the Exercise 11 text box on Canvas. Keep the questions and type your answers below each question:

1. What parts of your paper are you most proud of and why?
2. What parts of the paper do you think still need improvement and why?
3. How well do you think you addressed the assignment's guidelines and requirements?
4. What changes did you make on your draft after our conference?
5. Did you consult others for feedback? If yes, how did you do so and how helpful was it?
6. What was the most difficult part of the writing process and why?
7. What did you learn from writing this paper that you will apply to future writing assignments?
8. Do you have any suggestions for improving the Paper 1 process for next time I teach the course?

And the most important question:

9. What were the most significant things you will take from this course?

Please follow exercise guidelines, submit a  GenAI link or non-use statement, and submit an updated workload report under Exercise 10. Citations are not necessary for this exercise.
