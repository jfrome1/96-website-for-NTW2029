The purpose of this exercise is twofold. First, it will allow you to reflect on your class participation in this course. Second, it will help me better understand how Singapore students think about class participation.

Please write a paragraph of at least 100 words describing and evaluating your class participation in the class, as well as stating what grade you think you have earned. You may discuss anything you think is relevant. I won't use the grade you give yourself to determine your grade; that is mostly to get a better sense of student views and expectations.

Please follow exercise guidelines, include a  GenAI link or non-use statement, and submit an updated workload report under Exercise 10. Citations are not necessary for this exercise.
