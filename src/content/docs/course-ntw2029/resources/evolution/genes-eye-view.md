title: Gene's eye view and altruism (1.2)
date: 2025-01-18

- the gene's eye view theory was developed to solve a problem facing evolutionary theory: traits that seem to hurt an organism's ability to survive, such as altruism, don't seem to match the theory of natural selection or sexual selection
		- in ordinary language, "altruism" means helping others at some cost to yourself (even if the cost is just your time or attention)
	- we think of altruism as something motivated by morality, a positive human nature, or a good upbringing
	- in evolution, "altruism" means increasing another organism's reproductive fitness (i.e., their likelihood of passing on their genes) at a cost to your own
- animal e.g.s
	- bees sacrifice themselves for the hive
	- bats share blood with other bats who didn't get any
- altruism can be explained on the genetic level since typically altruism correlates with genetic relatedness
	- genes reproduce themselves by helping their copies that exist in other organisms
	- this is why the theory is sometimes called "the selfish gene" theory
	- we don't use that name (and its creator regrets the calling it that) because it doesn't explain selfish behavior of organisms, but its opposite, altruistic behavior!
- altruism can spread if "altruism genes" (just an analogy) help other organisms with "altruism genes", increasing the number of those genes in the population that makes up a species
