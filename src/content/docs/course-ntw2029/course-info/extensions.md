title: Extension policy

 _If you email me in advance_, any assignment, including final papers, may be submitted up to 24 hours late for any reason. Just [:email me](/course-ntw2029/course-info/tech-guidelines/#course-email) ([:don't message me](#x-dontmessageme) for this purpose) and say "I would like a 24 hour extension on [name of assignment]. I will [:submit it by](#x-submit) [extended due date]."

Due to this policy, no additional extensions will be granted except in serious, documented circumstances.

Please do not ask for additional extensions for any of the following reasons:

- extracurricular activities or club obligations (NUS affiliated or not)
- travel or holiday
- assignments or exams for other courses

Of course, if you are having trouble managing your workload, please ask for help. There are many resources available that I can help you find.

##### :x dont message me

I need a record of deadline extensions in one place. It's much easier for me to remember to extend your deadline on Canvas with email than with messages.

##### :x submit

It's important that you explicitly commit to submitting the assignment by the extended due date.
