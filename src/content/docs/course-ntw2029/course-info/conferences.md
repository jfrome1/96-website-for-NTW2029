title: Conference guidelines
date: 2024-08-16

---

I'll have at least three individual conferences with each student this semester. Conferences in this course are usually conducted via Zoom at this link: <https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome> or Meeting ID: 250 394 5161. If you have difficulties joining, email or message me to let me know what's going on.

## Bookings

I'll attempt to use Microsoft Bookings for the conferences. Check the conference sign-up time carefully, as my Bookings page uses 24-hour time. If you see only strange times (like middle of the night), [:check your settings](#x-checkyoursettings).

## Logistics

Please follow these guidelines to avoid distractions during the conference:

- Find in a quiet, indoor space without wind noise or other people nearby
- Keep your video on and check that your lighting is adequate
- Please do not eat during the conference
- Make every effort to be on time, but if you are going to be late, email me before the scheduled time to let me know when to expect you

## Preparation and follow-up

To make sure you get full benefit from the conference:

- Come to the conference prepared with specific questions; the conference is a time for you to use me as a resource, whether or not I have specific topics to discuss based on your draft
- Be prepared to take notes during the conference (if you type faster than you write, split the screen between Zoom and your notes, or use 2 monitors)
- Review the posted assignment instructions and and your submission before the conference
- Right after the conference, complete the assigned exercise to email me a brief summary of the conference, including the main points I made and your planned next steps. Do this quickly so you don't forget what we talked about.

##### :x check your settings

The likely problem is that your Microsoft account and calendar are not set to the Singapore time zone (even if your computer shows the correct time). To check:

1. sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. press the settings (1) button (the gear) on the top right of the page
3. under General (2) → Language and time (3), confirm that your time zone is UTC+08:00
	- if the time zone isn't Singapore, click on change (4) and choose the Singapore timezone
	- if the time zone is Singapore, change it to another time zone, and then change it back
4. under Calendar → View, check the "Display my calendar in time zone" and look for a "Yes, update" button to sync the calendar with the General time zone setting
