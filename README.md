## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## These will work for all pages as absolute links

- page link: Although we present a sample policy [here](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy)
- heading link: Although we present a sample policy [here](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy/#nus-general-genai-policy)
- image link (from public folder): ![Another File](/images/add-another-file.png)
- link to file for download (from public folder): [Another File](/downloads/formattedpaper.docx)
- Nutshell link to whole page (only works after build):[:This example](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy) links to `/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy`
- Nutshell heading link: [:LIKE THIS](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy/#nus-general-genai-policy)!
- Nutshell image link:(from public folder need to add the image to a heading) [:here](/#see-this-is-hidden-image)
- Nutshell link to file for download (Can't be done I think, you can put the link in the heading like below.)
- Nutshell image link:(from public folder need to add the download link to a heading below) [:here](/#see-this-is-hidden-download)

### :x See This Is Hidden Image

## To Test the links;

`npm run build` to build the site into the `dist` folder
`npm run preview` to preview the site locally
Be aware that live changes wont effect the site running on preview until you rebuild again.
